            The day, May 28th in the year 1990. Humanity was in turmoil. Criminals freely roamed the streets robbing, pillaging, murdering and worst of all... Still clung to their 1980s era fashion!
            The start of the new decade was beginning to look grim, when all of a sudden the dark clouds parted and a guitar solo only worthy of the ears of gods eruped from the heavens. Lightning crashed down 
            and a guitar clad warrior of metal emerged from the smoke, blinding light, and incomprehensible sound. The world would soon learn that Hayden Cross, the savior of humanity had arrived...
        </p>
        <p>
            The 90s came and went, humanity's wrongs were mostly righted, and civilization was able to move into the 21st century. With crime down and 1980s fashion a distant memory (and subsequently 90s fashion... JNCO Jeans anyone?)
            Hayden became just a simple boy, with no true mission. The president didn't call anymore, keys to the city were no longer given to him, the Hayden Signal never illuminated the night sky as it once had (Yes... Batman took that idea).
            Alas a life of normalcy began. The vicious guitar shredding continued through high school, with girls really being the only thing on his mind. Awkward attempts to ask girls out in high school ensued for our now zit faced hero with all 
            attempts thwarted by his lack of women skills. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Naturally Hayden ironed out his lady skills and basically became the next James Bond... But with the female sex conquered and high school behind him, this young man needed a new mission!
            Being an Epic Guitar Wielding Sex God was tiring for our hero. Hayden had to face the facts and realize that now he has to get a job. He began working as an EMT throughout the rest of his teens and early 20s
            Saving lives was (of no surprise) second nature to him. With a stint of living in Massachusetts and having returned to California, Hayden attended Paramedic school to further his EMS training, where later he would work as a paramedic in 
            the San Bernardino area. 
        </p>

            After countless more lives saved, Hayden eventually found out that he simply can't continue with this lifestyle. EMS was taxing on our hero. The long hours, the labor rights violations, poor working conditions and near poverty level pay had 
            angered him. After years of managers saying "if you don't like it then leave", Hayden took their word for it. EMS was a way of life our hero had identified with. Despite fond memories Hayden is now looking to the future, excited to see 
            what it holds. A new career in web development has become the new objective. With the help of Instructor Tanksley and his two trusty side-kicks Adam and Andy, Hayden Is going to get an A+ on this project and will then make that Zuckerberg money!
